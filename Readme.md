Training the model for the dataset using Neural Networks and regression methods.


For optimizing the model on the dataset, neural networks exhibited superior performance in predicting energy band gap and atomic energy, showcasing their efficacy in capturing complex relationships within the data.

Conversely, random forest regression emerged as the optimal choice for training the model to predict the Radius of Gyration of the polymer. This approach yielded minimized loss and cost function, indicating its proficiency in handling non-linear relationships and high-dimensional feature spaces.
